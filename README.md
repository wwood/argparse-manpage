This code is a fork of https://github.com/praiskup/argparse-manpage with various
opinions introduced, to make it easier to use for the usual style of the
Woodcroft lab bird tools. See also
https://github.com/wwood/bird_tool_utils-python/

Also in contrast to upstream, the main aim of this repository is to provide code
that allows formatting of manpages at runtime, rather than at install-time.
